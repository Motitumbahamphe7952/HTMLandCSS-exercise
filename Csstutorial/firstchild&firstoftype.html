    <!-- In CSS, the `:first-child` pseudo-class selects the first child element of its parent, regardless of the type of element. For example, `p:first-child` will select a `<p>` element if it is the very first child of its parent.

    The `:first-of-type` pseudo-class selects the first element of its type within its parent. For example, `p:first-of-type` will select the first `<p>` element among its siblings, even if it is not the first child of its parent. -->
